# Pokedex

## Overview 👀

📖 An app made with the scope of learning Angular Framework.
I started studying Angular from the official documentation on their website and followed the whole [Angular Tour of Heroes 🦸‍♂️](https://angular.io/tutorial). Then I discovered [PokeAPI 🌿](https://pokeapi.co/) and decided to make a self-made Pokedex using this wonderful API.

🔧 I used Observables and interaction with API, Material UI, CSS and SCSS, LocalStorage, JSONServer and many others.   

🌐 The app is accessible also from browser, it has been deployed via Vercel. Here is the [link](https://ngpokedex.vercel.app/). 
(Note that the Add section is dependent on the JSONserver tool so it is not functional except locally)


## Installation ✈️

Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies included in the project. Note that you'll need tha latest version of npm and node.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run api` to run the fake backend with JSONserver and interact with the add section.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
